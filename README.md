# k6 Load Testing Project Documentation

## Overview
This project contains scripts and resources for load testing using [k6](https://k6.io/). The main script, `loadtest.js`, defines the load test scenario, and `result.json` is used to store the output of test runs.

## Project Structure

- `loadtest.js`: The main k6 script that defines the load test.
- `result.json`: Stores the results of a k6 test run in JSON format.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install k6:**
   - On macOS, run:
     ```sh
     brew install k6
     ```
   - For other platforms, see the [k6 installation guide](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

2. **Clone or download this repository** to your local machine.

## Running the Load Test

To execute the load test and save the results to `result.json`, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
k6 run loadtest.js --out json=result.json
```

- This will execute the test as defined in `loadtest.js` and output the results in JSON format to `result.json`.

## Interpreting `result.json`

- The `result.json` file contains detailed metrics and results from the k6 test run.
- You can analyze this file manually or use tools to visualize the results, such as [k6 Report Generator](https://k6.io/docs/results-output/real-time/json-output/).

## Example Usage

1. Edit `loadtest.js` to define your test scenario (target URL, virtual users, duration, etc.).
2. Run the test as shown above.
3. Review the output in `result.json` for performance metrics and errors.
